# Eterna Core

Welcome to the official core repository for **Eterna**, a community-driven roleplaying game of will, worlds, and the vast tapestry of The Eternal.

Eterna is built openly and governed transparently, combining expansive worldbuilding, contested rolls, and dynamic planar magic.

## About Eterna

Eterna explores a multiverse of interwoven realms shaped by **Aura**, the energy of will. Characters, settings, and entire worlds emerge from the balance of forces across **The Eternal** — a cosmology of interconnected planes.

The system emphasizes:
- Resource management through Aura.
- Contested rolls that create partial outcomes and rich tension.
- An open-ended framework for building infinite worlds and settings.

The Eterna Core includes the System Reference Document (SRD), supporting tools, and foundational philosophies.
